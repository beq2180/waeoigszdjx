## Prototype notes

This version intentionally uses YAML instead of an external database. It is suitable for
testing and a first server prototype. Auction listings, balances, shop configuration,
and pending trades are persisted under `plugins/AIOEconomy/`.

The shop item command uses the item in the admin's main hand. The current shop section is
the most recently created section.

The auction house uses a simple listing GUI and click-to-buy behavior. A future version
can add expiration, bidding, pagination, tax, confirmation screens, permissions,
transactions/history, and database-backed storage.


### Shop item sections

Admin shop items can be placed directly into a specific section:

`/shopadd item <buyprice> <sellprice> <section>`

The section can contain multiple words. If the section is omitted, the most recently created section is used.

### NBT / custom item data

Shop entries and auction listings store the complete Paper `ItemStack` as raw NBT (Base64 encoded in YAML), rather than storing only the material. This preserves item data such as enchantments, custom model data, names/lore, potion data, trim/data components, and other supported item NBT when the item is bought, sold, listed, or removed from the auction house.

Shop selling and `/sell hand` / `/sell allhand` match the full item template with `ItemStack.isSimilar()`, so two items with the same material but different item data are treated as different shop items.
